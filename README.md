# improved-DohPro
a modification to DohPro to extend functionality

This is an extension of the original DohPro, created by Deviant Ollam.
The original is available here: https://github.com/deviantollam/DohPro

The original only renamed the GoPro "GH" high res files.  I use the low res "GL" files as proxy files when editing, so I
wanted the utility to change their extensions to mp4 and rename them to match the GH files.
